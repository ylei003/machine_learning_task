# machine_learning_task

The project will consist of completing the following three tasks that can be implemented on one or more of your chosen real-world datasets.
1.	Unsupervised Learning: where the problem consists of identifying homogeneous population groups or dimension reduction techniques, which can then be used in the context of the empirical application 
2.	Regression: where the problem consists of continuous target variable(s). 
3.	Classification: where problem consists of categorical target variable(s).
